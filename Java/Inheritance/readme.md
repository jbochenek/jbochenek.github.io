The INPUT FILE should be named input.txt and put in the same directory './input.txt' as the java file for it to read correctly. The file should be structured with each shape on a new row, with like this:

type x-coord y-coord z a

Where X is the x coordinate of the shape (not used in my code)

Y is the y coordinate of hte shape (not used in my code)

z is the radius or side length depending on shape

a is the height for triangles 

Not all values are used, and as long as they are provided in that order the code knows which ones to use.

For example: 

Circle 22 3 4 5

Square 12 2 45 3

Sphere 19 12 5 4
