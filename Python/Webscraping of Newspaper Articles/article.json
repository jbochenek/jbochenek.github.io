Right now, House Republicans are scrambling to pass something, but anything they pass with border wall funding will be dead in the water in the Senate.\n\nAt the current time, however, no key constituency has any reason to compromise.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nThe defining promise of Trump's 2016 campaign was to build a border wall. As long as a wall is getting built, he can probably get away with not having Mexico pay for it. But should he fail to deliver it in any form, it will significantly undermine his re-election campaign, becoming a symbol of the gap between his sweeping promises and reality. When it was reported that he was prepared to relent on wall funding, there was a strong backlash among many conservatives, inside and outside Congress, who were among his most dedicated supporters. He may have to end up caving either way, but if he shuts down government over the issue, he could at least argue that he fought hard for the wall. If he just signs on to yet another continuing resolution without going through a shutdown, it will look like an absolute surrender. So, he has every reason to make a stand here.\n\nCongressional Democrats\n\nTo avert a shutdown, Republicans need 60 votes in the Senate, meaning they can't do anything without some support from Democrats \u2014 and they could also require Democratic votes in the House to offset any large GOP defections. Democrats would be eviscerated by their base if, coming off of large gains in an election, they were to deliver Trump a major victory by giving him his coveted wall. They have not given Trump his wall funding in the past two years, and they are even less likely to now knowing two things: One, if they hold out, they will have more power come Jan. 3, when the new Democratic House majority is sworn in, with Nancy Pelosi as the leader. Two, Trump has already declared that he's prepared to shut down the government over border security, ensuring that Republicans will get the blame.\n\nHouse Republicans\n\nIf Trump is ready to hold out for a wall, there's no reason why conservative House Republicans would want to vote for legislation without a wall when their party still controls the House. They, too, want to show the base that they were willing to go all out for wall funding. Once the new Congress takes over, if the Democratic-controlled House cuts a deal with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Trump that does not include wall funding, then House conservatives won't have any fingerprints on it. They can vote against that continuing resolution and say they held their ground and point fingers at Pelosi and McConnell.\n\nThe low stakes of the \"shutdown\"\n\nAs government shutdowns go, the current one would be relatively uneventful. Congress has already passed spending bills to fund about three-quarters of the government, and with the Christmas and New Year's holiday week coming up, there isn't going to be much work getting done anyway. So, for all the likely messaging about the lumps of coal lawmakers are putting in people's Christmas stockings, any partial shutdown is going to have a very small effect on most people's lives.\n\nFor all of these reasons, I am expecting a shutdown.", "keywords": ["funding", "look", "beginning", "trump", "going", "republicans", "wall", "senate", "house", "lot", "border", "shutdown", "reason"], "summary": "Looking at where things stand ahead of a midnight Friday deadline, all signs are pointing to a partial government shutdown.\nRight now, House Republicans are scrambling to pass something, but anything they pass with border wall funding will be dead in the water in the Senate.\nPresident TrumpThe defining promise of Trump's 2016 campaign was to build a border wall.\nIf he just signs on to yet another continuing resolution without going through a shutdown, it will look like an absolute surrender.\nThey, too, want to show the base that they were willing to go all out for wall funding."}, {"link": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/20/rosenstein-barr-memo-mueller-probe-1071029", "published": "2018-12-20T17:17:00", "title": "Rosenstein: AG nominee's memo had 'no impact' on Mueller probe", "author": ["Rebecca Morin", "Steven Overly", "Ashley Gold", "John Hendel"], "text": "Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said that he believes that Barr will be \"an outstanding attorney general\" once he's confirmed. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Legal Rosenstein: AG nominee's memo had 'no impact' on Mueller probe\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Thursday that a memo critical of the ongoing Russia investigation written by President Donald Trump's nominee to be the next attorney general had no impact on the ongoing probe.\n\nThe memo, written last summer by attorney general nominee William Barr, was sharply critical of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into allegations of collusion between the Russian government and the 2016 Trump campaign. But Rosenstein said Barr's past memo would have no impact on Mueller's probe.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"The memo that you made reference to reflects Mr. Barr's personal opinion,\" Rosenstein said during a press conference on Thursday after announcing criminal charges for Chinese hackers. \"Lots of people offer opinions to the Department of Justice, but they don't influence our own decision making.\"\n\nBarr, who served as Attorney General under George H.W. Bush, submitted the memo on June 8 to Rosenstein and Assistant Attorney General Steve Engel, months before he was nominated to return to his former position atop the Justice Department.\n\nAccording to the memo, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, Barr expressed concern on Muller's probe widening to include possible obstruction of justice by the president.\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the memo \"was not undertaken lightly\" and that Congress needs \"answers as to why Barr proactively drafted this memo and then shared it with the deputy attorney general and President Trump\u2019s lawyers.\"\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for a lawyer in private practice to do this unless he was attempting to curry favor with President Trump and convey that he would protect the president,\" she said in a statement.\n\nBarr's nomination comes after Trump asked Jeff Sessions to step down from his position. Sessions had recused himself from overseeing Mueller's probe, a step that the president openly and regularly expressed his frustration with.\n\nActing Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who currently oversees the investigation, has also been criticized for past comments he's made critical of the Mueller probe. Whitaker did not recuse himself from overseeing the investigation, a decision for which he has been criticized by Mueller defenders.\n\nThe president has also been accused of appointing Whitaker to lead the Justice Department on an interim basis to restrict Mueller's investigation, a rationale that some critics of the president believe he applied again in choosing Barr to lead the department on a permanent basis.\n\n\"It\u2019s becoming pretty clear that the President is basing his choices for leadership at the Justice Department on candidates\u2019 criticism of the Mueller investigation,\" Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, wrote on Twitter.\n\nWarner later said during an interview on CNN that be believes the Barr memo was \"an attempt to solicit this position to say, 'hey Mr. Trump, don't worry I'll have your back on the Mueller investigation.'\"\n\n\"It appears that the No. 1 qualification Donald Trump's looking for in an attorney general is someone that will try to undermine the Mueller investigation,\" Warner said, adding that he believes the memo disqualifies Barr from the position.\n\nTrump has been open about his disdain for the investigation, referring to it often as a \"witch hunt,\" but has said that he will allow Mueller to complete the probe.\n\nRosenstein said that he believes that Barr will be \"an outstanding attorney general\" once he's confirmed and argued that Barr's opinion was based on not having access to \"actual facts of the case.\"\n\n\"Obviously, our decisions are informed by our knowledge of the actual facts of the case, which Mr. Barr didn't have,\" Rosenstein said. \"I didn't share any confidential information with Mr. Barr. He never requested that we provide any non-public information to him, and that memo had no impact on our investigation.\"\n\nBarr has previously asserted the need for attorney general's to have power to appoint and dismiss independent counsels.\n\nIn 1998, the former attorney general criticized a provision in the Ethics in Government Act, which expired in 1999, for creating an Office of the Special Counsel that he said was \"seriously flawed\" as it \"unduly restricted\" the attorney general \"in deciding the need for independent counsel.\"\n\nHe concluded that a new law should be created that ensures \"when the President, the Vice President or the Attorney General is involved in a criminal investigation, the Attorney General should be required under a new statute to recuse himself or herself from the case.\" But such a law, Barr wrote, should also allow the attorney general to \"remain accountable as the responsible official, entitled to dismiss the counsel or Justice Department official for cause.\"\n\nBarr has also offered more recent public commentary on the Russia investigation, dismissing concerns that the probe, then overseen by the FBI, was in jeopardy following Trump's decision to fire then-FBI director James Comey.\n\n\"According to news reports, the investigation is in full swing, with the Justice Department using a grand jury to subpoena relevant information, indicating a degree of thoroughness not evident in the investigation into Clinton's email server,\" Barr wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Post published in May of last year. \"Comey's removal simply has no relevance to the integrity of the Russian investigation as it moves ahead.\"\n\nThe Deputy Attorney General, at his Thursday press conference, also offered assurances that no matter who is overseeing the investigation, it will be \"handled appropriately.\n\n\"It's being handled appropriately, whether its Bob Mueller or Rod Rosenstein or Matt Whitaker or Bill Barr, that investigation is going to be handled appropriately by the Department of Justice,\" Rosenstein said.", "keywords": ["attorney", "general", "probe", "barr", "nominees", "rosenstein", "mueller", "ag", "justice", "president", "investigation", "department", "memo", "impact"], "summary": "Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said that he believes that Barr will be \"an outstanding attorney general\" once he's confirmed.\n| Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Legal Rosenstein: AG nominee's memo had 'no impact' on Mueller probeDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Thursday that a memo critical of the ongoing Russia investigation written by President Donald Trump's nominee to be the next attorney general had no impact on the ongoing probe.\nBut Rosenstein said Barr's past memo would have no impact on Mueller's probe.\nBush, submitted the memo on June 8 to Rosenstein and Assistant Attorney General Steve Engel, months before he was nominated to return to his former position atop the Justice Department.\nActing Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who currently oversees the investigation, has also been criticized for past comments he's made critical of the Mueller probe."}, {"link": "https://weather.com/forecast/regional/news/2018-12-20-east-coast-flood-threat-forecast", "published": "2018-12-20T14:15:07", "title": "East Coast Storm a Severe Weather Threat in Florida, Carolinas; Another Flood Threat in One of Wettest Years on Record in East", "author": [], "text": "01:11 Flood Watches Issued for Northeast as Rain Continues Christmas travelers will likely encounter delays in the East late this week as a new storm system brings widespread rain \u2013 even thunderstorms for some \u2013 but relatively little snow.\n\nAt a Glance Just days before Christmas, heavy rain, not snow is again on the table in the East.\n\nHeavy rain will fall from Florida to New England through Friday.\n\nThis will trigger both flash flooding and renewed river flooding.\n\nSevere thunderstorms are also possible from Florida to the Carolinas.\n\nThis is only the latest soaker in one of the wettest years on record.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Dartunorro Clark\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen faced a barrage of criticism from House Democrats on Thursday in a testy hearing on the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nIn one particularly heated exchange, Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois called the DHS chief a liar after she defended the administration policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"It is as if you can\u2019t see the reality of modern immigration or contributions of anyone who came from countries other than Norway or other parts of Europe. It\u2019s as if you and the Trump administration are blind,\" he said. \"Shame on everybody that separates children and allows them to stay at the other side of the border fearing death, fearing hunger, fearing sickness. Shame on us for wearing our badge of Christianity during Christmas for allowing the secretary to come here and lie.\"\n\nNielsen has been under intense scrutiny from lawmakers and the public over the past months for enforcing the administration's staunch anti-immigration policies. President Donald Trump has also reportedly expressed displeasure with her job performance.\n\nAt the hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, however, Nielsen firmly defended the administration's practices by insisting, as she has in the past, that no such family separation policy existed.\n\nShe fired back at Gutierrez calling her a liar, saying, \"Only to say that calling me a liar is fighting words. I'm not a liar, we've never had a policy for family separation.\"\n\nA family separation policy, she said, \"would mean that any family that I found at a port of entry I would separate, it would mean that every single family that I found illegally crossing, we would separate. We did none of those.\"\n\nAt least 2,600 children were separated from their parents under the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy at the border, which was in effect from May 6 through June 20. Under pressure, Trump signed an executive order in June to end the practice and allow families to be detained together.\n\nRep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., also asked Nielsen about whether the Department of Homeland Security lost track of separated families.

She did not have to die. Jackie did not have to die,\" Jackson said, questioning why there were not more medical and language services immediately available at the time. \"These are human beings!\"\n\nNielsen claimed that Maquin's father did not indicate any health concerns at first, saying CBP revived her twice before they got her to a hospital.\n\n\"To put this in perspective, this is exactly why we try to encourage migrants to go a port of entry. Unfortunately, they arrived in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere,\" she said. \"As soon as [the father] indicated there was a health issue, we did what we could do as quickly as possible to get her to medical care ... the men and women of CBP did everything they could do.\"\n\nLater, Nielsen was asked about Trump's demand for $5 billion from Congress to build his long-promised border wall. She sidestepped the question of why the president threatened to shut down the government over funding for the wall, despite his repeated insistence that Mexico would foot the bill. She said she does not believe the government should shut down over the wall, but also said she did not disagree with the president's position.\n\n\"So, I guess I'm confused. If Mexico is supposed to pay for the border wall, why is the Trump administration and your department of Homeland Security petitioning Congress for $5 billion dollars in American taxpayer money to pay for that same wall?\" Rep.

Add Interest\n\nIt was another miserable day on Wall Street as a series of big December plunges continued, putting stocks on track for their worst month in a decade.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 464 points Thursday, bringing its losses to more than 1,700 points since Friday.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index has slumped 10.6 percent this month and is almost 16 percent below the peak it reached in late September.\n\nThe steady gains of this spring and summer now fell like a distant memory. As we've entered the fall, investors started to worry that global economic growth is cooling off and that the U.S. could slip into a recession in the next few years. The S&P 500 is on track for its first annual loss in a decade.\n\nThe technology stocks that have led the market in recent years are now dragging it down. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite is now down 19.5 percent from the record high it reached in August.\n\nThe market swoon is coming even as the U.S. economy is on track to expand this year at the fastest pace in 13 years. Markets tend to move, however, on what investors anticipate will happen well into the future, so it's not uncommon for stocks to sink even when the economy is humming along.\n\nRight now, markets are concerned about the potential for a slowing economy and two threats that could make the situation worse: the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China, which has lasted most of this year, and rising interest rates, which act as a brake on economic growth by making it more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow money.\n\nThe selling in the last two days came after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the fourth time this year and signaled it was likely to continue raising rates next year, although at a slower rate than it previously forecast.\n\nScott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said investors felt Fed Chairman Jerome Powell came off as unconcerned about the state of the U.S. economy, despite deepening worries on Wall Street that growth could slow even more in 2019 and 2020. Wren said investors want to know that the Fed is keeping a close eye on the situation.\n\n\"He may be a little overconfident,\" said Wren. \"The Fed needs to be paying attention to what's going on.\"\n\nPowell also acknowledged that the Fed's decisions are getting trickier because they need to be based on the most up-to-date figures on jobs, inflation, and economic growth. For the last three years the Fed told investors weeks in advance that it was almost certain to increase rates. But things are less certain now, and the market hates uncertainty.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the market's reaction to the Fed was \"completely overblown.\"\n\nInvestors have responded to a weakening outlook for the U.S. economy by selling stocks and buying ultra-safe U.S. government bonds. The bond-buying has the effect of sending long-term bond yields lower, which reduces interest rates on mortgages and other kinds of long-term loans. That's generally good for the economy.\n\nAt the same time, the reduced bond yields can send a negative signal on the economy. Sharp drops in long-term bond yields are often seen as precursors to recessions.\n\nThe S&P 500 index skidded 39.54 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,467.42. The Dow fell 464.06 points, or 2 percent, to 22,859.60 after sinking as much as 679.\n\nThe Nasdaq fell 108.42 points, or 1.6 percent, to 6,528.41. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies dropped another 23.23 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,326.\n\nSmaller company stocks have been crushed during the recent market slump because slower growth in the U.S. will have an outsize effect on their profits. Relative to their size, they also tend to carry more debt than larger companies, which could be a problem in a slower economy with higher interest rates.\n\nThe Russell 2000 is down almost 24 percent from the peak it reached in late August and it's down 13.6 percent for the year to date. The S&P 500, which tracks larger companies, is down 7.7 percent.\n\nThe possibility of a partial shutdown of the federal government also loomed over the market on Thursday, as funding for the government runs out at midnight Friday. In general, shutdowns don't affect the U.S. economy or the market much unless they stretch out for several weeks, which would delay paychecks for federal employees.\n\nOil prices continued to retreat. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 4.8 percent to $45.88 a barrel in New York, and it's dropped 40 percent since early October. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 percent to $54.35 a barrel in London.\n\nAfter early gains, bond prices headed lower. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose to 2.87 percent from 2.65 percent, while the 10-year note rose to 2.80 percent from 2.77 percent.\n\nThe gap between those two yields has shrunk this year. When the 10-year yield falls below the two-year yield, investors call it an \"inverted yield curve.\" That hasn't happened yet, but investors fear it will. Inversions are often taken as a sign a recession is coming, although it's not a perfect signal and when recessions do follow inversions in the yield curve, it can take a year or more.\n\n\"The bond market has been telling us something for about a year, and that is there's not going to be much inflation and there's not going to be a sustained surge in economic growth,\" said Wren, of Wells Fargo.\n\nIn France, the CAC 40 lost 1.8 percent and Germany's DAX fell 1.4 percent. The British FTSE 100 slipped 0.8 percent. Indexes in Italy, Portugal and Spain took bigger losses.\n\nTokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 2.8 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gave up 1 percent. Seoul's Kospi shed 0.9 percent.\n\nAs investors adjusted to the prospect of a weaker economy and lower long-term interest rates, the dollar fell to 111.11 yen from 112.36 yen. The euro rose to $1.1469 from $1.1368.\n\nThe British pound rose to $1.2671 from $1.2621. That sent the price of gold higher, and it gained 0.9 percent to $1,267.9 an ounce. Silver rose 0.3 percent to $14.87 an ounce and copper, which is considered an indicator of economic growth, fell 0.7 percent to $2.70 a pound.\n\nOther fuel prices also fell. Wholesale gasoline lost 4.6 percent to $1.32 a gallon and heating oil slid 3.1 percent to $1.75 a gallon. Natural gas gave up 3.8 percent to $3.58 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak contributed to this story from Washington.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP", "keywords": ["worsen", "dow", "economy", "investors", "rates", "interest", "slowdown", "fell", "growth", "yield", "stocks", "sinks", "464", "market", "fears", "points"], "summary": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 464 points Thursday, bringing its losses to more than 1,700 points since Friday.\nThe bond-buying has the effect of sending long-term bond yields lower, which reduces interest rates on mortgages and other kinds of long-term loans.\nThe Dow fell 464.06 points, or 2 percent, to 22,859.60 after sinking as much as 679.\nWhen the 10-year yield falls below the two-year yield, investors call it an \"inverted yield curve.\"\nSilver rose 0.3 percent to $14.87 an ounce and copper, which is considered an indicator of economic growth, fell 0.7 percent to $2.70 a pound."}, {"link": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/20/18150393/apple-iphone-7-8-german-stores-qualcomm-injuction-lawsuit", "published": "2018-12-20T18:53:18", "title": "Apple will pull older iPhones from its German stores after Qualcomm wins partial ban", "author": ["Dec"], "text": "Apple will be pulling iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models from its stores in Germany following a win for Qualcomm in the District Court of Munich, which ruled that Apple\u2019s devices were infringing on Qualcomm\u2019s intellectual property related to power savings in smartphones.\n\nAccording to CNBC, Apple is already working to appeal the ruling, but the company has stated that as part of that process, it will be suspending sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 in the 15 Apple stores in Germany.

Picture taken August 3, 2017. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle/File Photo\n\nQualcomm\u2019s win in Germany comes weeks after it secured a court order to ban sales of some iPhone models in China. Apple, which is contesting both rulings, has continued to offer its iPhones in China but made changes to its iOS operating system in the wake of the Chinese order.\n\nThe German victory may affect only a few million iPhones out of the hundreds of millions that Apple sells each year. Still, it is a small but clear win in a complex legal battle that will spin into overdrive in the coming months as antitrust regulators and Apple both take Qualcomm to court in the United States.\n\nApple alleges that Qualcomm engaged in illegal behavior to preserve a monopoly on modem chips, which help mobile devices connect to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of using the chip supplier\u2019s vast stable of technology innovations without proper compensation.\n\nWhile a sales ban in China could hurt Apple\u2019s bottom line, it is unlikely the two patent skirmishes will sway the outcome of the broader battle, where Qualcomm has suffered a series of setbacks fighting U.S. antitrust regulators.\n\nShares of Apple were down 2.3 percent at $157.12 in late trading, weighing on the broader market.\n\nQualcomm shares were down 0.2 percent at $56.69.\n\nQualcomm is not pursuing the software patents in the Chinese case in other jurisdictions and suffered an early loss while pursuing a U.S. sales ban on the U.S. version of the hardware patent at issue in Germany.\n\nOLDER PHONES PULLED\n\nOn Thursday, Apple said it would pull older iPhones from its German stores after a court ruled that Apple had infringed a hardware patent of Qualcomm Inc and banned sales of iPhones there with chips from Apple supplier Qorvo Inc.\n\n\u201cTwo respected courts in two different jurisdictions just in the past two weeks have now confirmed the value of Qualcomm\u2019s patents and declared Apple an infringer, ordering a ban on iPhones in the important markets of Germany and China,\u201d Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement.\n\nFor each of the two Apple entities it won orders against, Qualcomm needs to post a bond of about 668.4 million euros, or $765.9 million, before it can begin proceedings to enforce the order, a move Qualcomm said it would carry out \u201cwithin a few days.\u201d\n\nThe smartphone maker said it was appealing the decision, but the order goes into effect as soon as Qualcomm posts the bond.\n\nApple said it would pull some phones from its stores while it pursued an appeal.\n\n\u201cWe are of course disappointed by this verdict and we plan to appeal,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cAll iPhone models remain available to customers through carriers and resellers in 4,300 locations across Germany. During the appeal process, iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models will not be available at Apple\u2019s 15 retail stores in Germany. iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR will remain available in all our stores.\u201d\n\nStacy Rasgon, an analyst with research firm Bernstein, said in a note that Germnany was a small iPhone market for Apple, selling about 10 million units a year, with possibly only half of those being the older models affected by the court\u2019s order.\n\nWhen Qualcomm posts the bond to enforce the order, it could seek to extend the ban to Apple\u2019s resellers and the newer iPhone models not included thus far, legal experts said.\n\nQualcomm said the court had granted its request for \u201ca recall and destruction of all accused devices from all retailers in Germany.\u201d\n\nRISKS\n\nBut pressing forward with enforcement presents some risks for Qualcomm. In an earlier proceeding before the U.S. International Trade Commission, U.S. regulators viewed a more extensive set of technical evidence about whether Qorvo\u2019s chips and Apple\u2019s phones violated Qualcomm\u2019s patents.\n\nThose U.S. regulators sided with Apple and Qorvo. If higher courts in Germany do the same when Apple appeals, Qualcomm could be forced to forfeit its bond if the decision becomes final.\n\nThe German case is Qualcomm\u2019s third major effort to secure a ban on Apple\u2019s lucrative iPhones over patent infringement allegations after similar efforts in the U.S. and China.\n\nIn the United States, Qualcomm sought to ban the import of iPhones with chips from Intel Corp. Trade regulators found Apple had infringed one Qualcomm patent, but so far declined to ban the phones with Intel chips because regulators feared it would hurt competition in the chip marketplace.\n\n\u201cCompetition authorities around the world have repeatedly found Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices unlawful, yet Qualcomm continues to try to achieve the same results through a campaign of patent lawsuits,\u201d Steven Rodgers, Intel\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement after the ruling in Germany.\n\nIn Germany, the judge ruled that phones with a chip from Apple supplier Qorvo violate one of Qualcomm\u2019s patents around so-called envelope tracking, a feature that helps mobile phones save battery power while sending and receiving wireless signals.\n\nMike Baker, Qorvo\u2019s chief intellectual property counsel, said in a statement that U.S. trade regulators had ruled that Qorvo\u2019s chips did not violate the U.S. version of Qualcomm\u2019s patent and that the chip\u2019s inventor wasn\u2019t allowed to testify at the German hearing.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cWe believe our envelope tracking chip does not infringe the patent in suit, and the court would have come to a different conclusion if it had considered all the evidence,\u201d Baker said.\n\nIn China, Apple is still pursuing a so-called request for reconsideration with the court that issued the bans.\n\nApple said its phones remained on sale and it believed it has complied with the Chinese court\u2019s order, but it also made changes to its iPhone software in the wake of the ruling.

Driver installation through Windows Update caused significant issues in the past, e.g. when old drivers were offered even though newer versions were installed already or when drivers were offered that were not designed for the particular hardware device.\n\nTip: you can disable driver updates through Windows Updates.\n\nThe driver distribution change starts at Independent Hardware Vendors (IHV) such as AMD, Intel, or NVIDIA. These test hardware components they develop; part of the testing involves making sure that the hardware is compatible with supported versions of Windows.\n\nVendors use the Windows Hardware Lab Kit to automate testing processes and may offer drivers for the hardware components on their websites.\n\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers are next in the chain. Companies like Dell, Lenovo or Asus, run tests to ensure that drivers work in their devices. These companies work hand in hand with IHVs to address any issues discovered during testing.\n\nValidated drivers are released on the OEMs websites and through updating tools if provided.\n\nMicrosoft is last in the driver distribution chain. IHVs and OEMs submit drivers to Microsoft for inclusion via Windows Update.\n\nIHVs and OEMs submit drivers to Microsoft, and we flight these drivers within our engineering system and, eventually, to Windows Insiders.\n\nDrivers are approved or rejected based on metrics during these flights. Microsoft revealed that it tests more than 100 drives every single day.\n\nWindows Driver quality\n\nFortin and Frankum reveal that driver quality has gone up in recent time. One of the graphs posted shows the percentage of crash-free devices from July 2017 to December 2018. The value was just below 97% in July 2017 and has gone up to more than 98% in November 2018.\n\nWhile that means that more than 98% of devices did not experience crashes in that particular month, it still means that more than 1% of devices crash because of drivers. In other words: millions of Windows 10 devices crash each month because of driver issues.\n\nMicrosoft published a second graph that compares crashes between August 2016 and September 2017.\n\nMicrosoft states that it saw \"significant improvement\". The graph is problematic as we cannot put the values from 2016 and 2017 in correlation because of missing x-axis and y-axis values.\n\nWe don't know if driver crashes dropped by 10%, 1%, 0.1% or 0.00001% between 2016 and 2017.\n\nMicrosoft admits that \"there is more work\" to be done.\n\nNow You: How do you install drivers?

It wasn\u2019t much to look at in the beginning; a seven-page document with only two tables of data. Once in a while, Apple would tack on a new table of data as the government would ask for new kinds of customer data.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t sustainable, nor was it particularly easy to read \u2014 especially for the hawkish handful who would obsessively read and digest each report.\n\nAs other companies, like Microsoft and Google, received more demands over the years, they began to expand their own reports to help users to better understand who wanted their data, why and how often. Apple knew its document-only reports didn\u2019t cut it, and took a leaf from its Silicon Valley neighbors and pushed ahead with its own plan to publish its biannual numbers in a way that ordinary people \u2014 like its customers \u2014 can read and understand.\n\nThe company\u2019s latest transparency report, out Thursday, still comes in its traditional PDF format for those who don\u2019t like change, but now also has its own dedicated, browsable and interactive corner of Apple\u2019s website. The new site breaks down the figures by country \u2014 but also historically to provide trends, patterns and context over years\u2019 worth of reporting cycles, in a way that\u2019s more in line with how other tech giants report their government data demands.\n\nAnd, the company has CSV files for download, containing raw data for academics to drill deeper down into the numbers.\n\nApple has also reworked how it discloses national security requests, such as FBI-issued subpoenas like national security letters (NSLs) and orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA). Since the introduction of the Freedom Act in 2015, passed in response to the NSA surveillance scandal in 2013, companies were given three options of reporting their secret orders \u2014 including the numerical bands it can release under what time period. Most companies disclosed the secret requests in bands of 500 with a six-month reporting delay to avoid any inadvertent interference with active investigations. Apple originally released its figures in bands of 250 requests, but is now expanding that to bands of 500 requests to standardize its reporting with other tech companies. It\u2019s also breaking out its FISA content (such as photos, email, contacts and device backups) and non-content requests (like subscriber records and transactional logs).\n\nAs for the figures, the transparency report reveals a rise in worldwide demands for data.\n\nAccording to the report, Apple received 32,342 demands \u2014 up 9 percent on the last reporting period \u2014 to access 163,823 devices in the second half of the year.\n\nThe report found Germany as the top requester, issuing 13,704 requests for data on 26,160 devices. Apple said that the figures were due to the high volume of device requests due to stolen devices. The U.S. was in second place with 4,570 requests for 14,911 devices.\n\nApple also received 4,177 requests for account data, such as information stored in iCloud \u2014 up by almost 25 percent on the previous reporting period \u2014 affecting some 40,641 accounts, a four-fold increase. The company said the spike was attributable to China, which asked for thousands of devices\u2019 worth of data under a single fraud investigation.\n\nAnd, the company saw a 30 percent increase in requests to preserve data for up to three months to 1,579 cases, affecting 4,033 accounts, while law enforcement obtained the right legal process to access the data.\n\nThe company also said it received between 0 and 499 national security orders, including secret rulings from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, affecting 1,000 and 1,499 accounts.

Thursday's hearing came in response to a motion filed by Brafman to dismiss the remaining counts or to hold evidentiary hearings on whether certain witnesses can testify.\n\nThe judge denied both requests, saying the defendant can explore witness credibility issues at trial, court documents show.\n\nAttorney Gloria Allred, who represents one of the alleged victims, said she is satisfied that the case will move to a pretrial hearing, adding that the case against Weinstein is strong.\n\n\"This indictment was based on evidence and testimony before the grand jury,\" she said upon leaving court. \"It was not based on the #MeToo movement. So, let's be clear about that.\"\n\nActresses Marisa Tomei and Kathy Najimy, as well as members of Time's Up, the Hollywood movement formed in response to Weinstein, attended Thursday's hearing.\n\n\"Together, we stand in solidarity with all survivors everywhere,\" Time's Up president and CEO Lisa Borders said outside court. \"Frankly, we are relieved that Harvey Weinstein failed in his efforts to avoid accountability for his actions, and we are very happy that none of the charges were dismissed.\"\n\nHow we got here\n\nThough publicly reviled since last year's harrowing stories in The New York Times and The New Yorker, the criminal case against Weinstein has shown some signs of unraveling in recent months.\n\nIn October, prosecutors dismissed one charge against Weinstein after officials learned of inconsistencies in one accuser's story and learned that a detective had failed to bring those issues to prosecutors.\n\nThe detective told an accuser to delete cell phone messages before turning her phones over to authorities, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said. The detective was taken off the case.\n\nBrafman argued the case was \"irreparably tainted by police misconduct\" and wanted it dismissed. In lieu of that, Weinstein's attorney also had asked for an evidentiary hearing to examine conduct by police and prosecutors in the case.\n\nWeinstein faces five felony charges: two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of criminal sexual act in the first degree and one count each of first-degree rape and third-degree rape.\n\nWeinstein, once one of the most powerful film producers in Hollywood, has been accused by a number of women, including several well-known actresses, of using his influence to sexually harass and assault them and then to avoid repercussions. His downfall led women across the world to speak out about similar allegations involving powerful figures abusing their power, a cultural force known as the #MeToo movement.\n\nBut despite its power, the #MeToo movement has had few test cases in criminal court.

What they really want\u2014even if they don\u2019t realize it\u2014is a single beauty product that can take care of all their skincare needs. Why buy three separate face creams when you can get one that does it all? That also seems to be the philosophy behind Second Act itself, a comedy that attempts to cram at least three different movies into one glossy package. To its credit, it remains fairly watchable even as it veers around wildly in tone. Yet Second Act also proves that all-in-one products have their downsides. Prioritizing quantity over quality doesn\u2019t often add up to something greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharismatic as ever in her first return to big screen comedy since 2012, Lopez stars as Maya, a big-box store employee who has revolutionized output and morale at her store, but is turned down for a promotion because of her lack of a college degree. That makes for a rather depressing 40th birthday celebration and inspires her computer wiz godson to apply some desperate measures to these desperate times. He gives Maya an online makeover, filling her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with Ivy League credentials, Mandarin fluency, and coxswain experience while dressing up her personal pages with hikes up Kilimanjaro and photo ops with the Obamas. Maya\u2019s newly swankified profile winds up landing her an interview for a high-paying consultant position at a Procter & Gamble-esque company. As the film helpfully points out, however, it\u2019s Maya\u2019s tangible in-store experience with the company\u2019s products that actually earns her the gig.\n\nCo-written by Lopez\u2019s longtime producing partner/first time screenwriter Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, Second Act plays like a spiritual sequel to Lopez\u2019s 2003 romantic comedy Maid In Manhattan, another film about a working class woman posing as a member of the upper crust. There, however, the fake identity hijinks were in the name of love, here they\u2019re in the name of career. Maya gets an obligatory romantic arc involving her longtime boyfriend Trey (Milo Ventimiglia, in full This Is Us mode) and her uncertainty over whether she wants to start a family with him. The most interesting thing about that subplot is the conspicuous ADR that implies it was heavily reworked in post-production. Mostly, Second Act follows in the vein of films like Morning Glory and The Devil Wears Prada, which ape the aesthetics of a romantic comedy but are first and foremost about work. At its best, the film calls back to classic female empowerment workplace comedies like 9 To 5 and Working Girl. The relatively cohesive first act effectively builds up the pressure of the small, subtle indignities Maya faces from male higher-ups before delivering some satisfying wish fulfillment in her \u201cfuck the man\u201d departure for greener pastures.\n\nPhoto: STX Entertainment\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce Maya fraudulently earns her new gig, however, Second Act can\u2019t quite seem to decide what it wants to do with its premise, so it basically devolves into two parallel films that just happen to feature the same characters. One is a slapstick comedy about Maya trying to maintain her cover while participating in a 10-week intercompany competition to redesign their organic beauty line. (That\u2019s where her three-in-one beauty product idea comes in; shockingly, it has ties to the bombing of Hiroshima, of all things.) The other is a melodrama about Maya grappling with painful events from her troubled youth while slowly bonding with workplace rival-turned-friend Zoe (Vanessa Hudgens, stretching ever so slightly beyond her usual bubbly onscreen persona). The film\u2019s discordant tones could be a product of its duel screenwriters (The Bucket List\u2019s Justin Zackham co-wrote the script with Goldsmith-Thomas). Or perhaps it\u2019s the hand of director Peter Segal (Tommy Boy, Anger Management), who can\u2019t seem to go more than a scene or two without throwing in a pratfall or broad comedic gag.\n\n\n\nRegardless, those ever-shifting tones are a lot to swallow, particularly once the movie starts tossing in more twists beyond Maya\u2019s faked r\u00e9sum\u00e9. That Second Act doesn\u2019t feel nearly as messy as it sounds on paper largely comes down to Lopez, an actor with an inherent magnetism that calls to mind the best old Hollywood stars. She always feels like a steady hand at the wheel, even when Second Act starts swerving off course. Lopez gets a decent scene partner in Hudgens and an even better one in Leah Remini, who steals the movie as Maya\u2019s brassy, no-nonsense best friend. Second Act\u2019s pat message about the importance of being true to yourself doesn\u2019t land with much impact. But the film finds a more winning formula in its low-key exploration of female friendship and the value of an outsider\u2019s perspective.\n\n", "keywords": ["film", "romantic", "review", "offers", "lopezs", "lopez", "overstuffed", "act", "second", "jennifer", "maya", "price", "mayas", "movies", "comedy", "movie"], "summary": "Photo: STX EntertainmentMovie Review Movie Review Second Act C+ Movie Review Second Act C+ C+ Second Act Director Peter Segal Runtime 103 minutes Rating PG-13 Language English Cast Jennifer Lopez, Leah Remini, Vanessa Hudgens, Treat Williams, Milo Ventimiglia Availability Theaters everywhere December 21Halfway through Second Act, Jennifer Lopez\u2019s working-class-gal-turned-high-end-beauty-industry-consultant has a revelation: Consumers are overwhelmed by the enormity of choices out there.\nThat also seems to be the philosophy behind Second Act itself, a comedy that attempts to cram at least three different movies into one glossy package.\nYet Second Act also proves that all-in-one products have their downsides.\nMostly, Second Act follows in the vein of films like Morning Glory and The Devil Wears Prada, which ape the aesthetics of a romantic comedy but are first and foremost about work.\nShe always feels like a steady hand at the wheel, even when Second Act starts swerving off course."}, {"link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/12/20/travis-scott-and-kylie-jenner-will-get-married-soon/", "published": "2018-12-20T20:00:00", "title": "Travis Scott and Kylie Jenner will get married \u2018soon\u2019", "author": ["December"], "text": "Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nChurch bells are ringing.\n\nTravis Scott and Kylie Jenner are going to tie the knot.

Machado and agent Dan Lozano arrived at Yankee Stadium and were greeted by a contingent consisting at least of GM Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone and veteran starter CC Sabathia, writes Martin, though other members of the organization were likely present. The meeting has been anticipated since weekend reports indicated that Machado would sit down for in-person visits with the White Sox, Yankees and Phillies this week. The face-to-face with the ChiSox came yesterday, and Machado is reportedly slated to meet with the Phillies tomorrow.\n\nThe meeting at Yankee Stadium lasted for roughly 90 minutes, though the Yankees\u2019 courtship of Machado extended beyond that point.

However, Heyman definitively states that the market for Machado, at present, consists of the White Sox, Yankees and Phillies with \u201cno mysteries\u201d in play.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that the Yankees are a significant factor in the Machado auction. While Martin wrote in his column that \u201cindications are they won\u2019t invest $300 million over 10 years,\u201d USA Today\u2019s Bob Nightengale tweets that the Yankees are \u201cenamored\u201d and believe him to be the \u201cperfect fit\u201d for their franchise. Whether that means topping the White Sox, the Phillies and any \u201cmystery\u201d suitors that may or may not truly be in the mix is another question entirely, though.\n\nUltimately, managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner will have to give the go-ahead to offer what could end up a record-setting deal to bring Machado to the Yankees.

However, Steinbrenner implied to Nightengale last month that Machado would be explaining those comments and actions to Cashman, whom ownership trusts to make that type of call. \u201cBut that\u2019s really [GM Brian Cashman\u2019s] job,\u201d said Steinbrenner at the time. \u201cIf we\u2019re interested in any player, to sit down with them face to face and ask him, \u2019Where did this come from?

The Ravens reworked their playbook to make Jackson\u2019s dynamic running the focal point.\n\nA lot has been made of the Ravens\u2019 run-heavy offense since rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson became the starter five weeks ago. In an age when the NFL is becoming more enamored with throwing the ball, the Ravens have \u201cswung further in the direction of option football than any team in modern NFL history, and they\u2019ve looked like one of the best teams in the league since doing so,\u201d according to Pro Football Focus\u2019 Mike Renner in an article he wrote for The Washington Post .\n\nIf you don't have a top-10 quarterback you should be taking notes on the Ravens offense: https://t.co/VPj9aB9BgH\n\n\u201cBaltimore isn\u2019t simply reading the edge defender on the line of scrimmage with your standard inside zone play over and over,\u201d Renner wrote. \u201cInstead, they\u2019re throwing all kinds of distractions at opposing defenses, and wishing them good luck in trying to guess where the ball is going.\u201d\n\nThe options have been tremendously successful, as the Ravens are averaging 5.5 yards per carry, which is a full yard more than the league average. To Renner, a key for the option being so successful for the Ravens has been the various wrinkles the team has added to those plays.\n\nRenner took a look at what plays have been featured more heavily with Jackson and found two, with the first being the option. According to Renner, the Ravens have run 109 options since Jackson became the starter, which is 50 more than the next-closest team.\n\nIndeed, the various motions the Ravens have been running prior to snapping the ball have given defenses a lot to think about. Not only do opposing defenses have to guess where the ball is going, but they also aren\u2019t sure what kind of runner they\u2019re going to have to try to stop: the ridiculously quick Jackson, or on many plays, the bruising style of running back Gus Edwards.\n\nRenner also believes running options puts less pressure on the offensive line. Yes, the line cannot allow opposing defenders to run through unimpeded and break up the play. But with the variety of runners the Ravens can hand the ball to, defenders have to guess more, which means a missed block here or there doesn\u2019t matter quite as much.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a bad Ravens offensive line by any means, but there is a reason over that same span they\u2019re only averaging 4.5 yards per carry on non-option runs,\u201d Renner wrote. \u201cOptions can create positive plays through nothing more than scheme and athletic ball-carriers, and the Ravens have both going for them right now.\u201d\n\nThe other type of play Baltimore has utilized heavily with Jackson is play-action passes.

But they must not forget how to win ugly as they look to play pretty.\n\nWhen Jose Mourinho came to Chelsea the first time, he completely entrenched a culture. He made the team feel like the constant underdog, punching above their weight and winning against all odds. The reality was that the team quickly became one of the best in the world but the culture of the club was so entrenched that they never felt as such.\n\nThis allowed the Blues to win even when it felt impossible. And when they had fallen away from the best in the world, they still had that mentality that they could beat anyone through sheer force of will.\n\nChelsea rode that culture all the way through the tenure of Antonio Conte. Then the board, perhaps seeing that what Mourinho built was fading more and more, opted to bring in a manager to build a new culture at Chelsea. Maurizio Sarri was brought in to create something new. But he must not allow the Blues to forget the method that got them this far.\n\nSarri is an attack first type of manager. His tactics are built from the attacking (or possession) phase down. Since it is such a radical departure from what Chelsea has done, it will take time to implement. In the meantime, some matches will look completely awful as Chelsea rack up passes without point or pleasure.\n\nIt is in these moments that Chelsea needs to keep the mentality Mourinho put into the side; ugly wins are still wins. The Blues may want to play beautiful, attacking football but an ugly scrappy goal counts just as much as a well worked one.\n\nChelsea would not have beaten Bournemouth in the League Cup without an ugly goal. The Blues dominated possession and were able to attack often, but they had no penetration with all their possession. It was not a case of \u201cEden Hazard bails Chelsea out again\u201d as seems to be the media narrative.

As fatal overdoses peaked last year, Baltimore handed out more than four times as many naloxone kits per capita as the District; and Philadelphia, more than three times as many, according to city data. Officials at the nonprofit groups that collaborated with the District on its naloxone campaign called it \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d and \u201cdisastrous.\u201d\n\nThe city has also faltered in carrying out a federally sponsored initiative to connect long-term heroin users with treatment. Although D.C. officials in 2017 began receiving what will ultimately total $4 million over two years from the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), many programs the city said it would launch never materialized. Officials at the clinic contracted by the District with most of its federal funds said not a single patient has been referred to them for addiction treatment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just pure incompetence,\u201d said Larry Gourdine of Medical Home Development Group (MHDG), which received nearly $1.5 million of the city\u2019s grant money. \u201cThis is not that difficult. I mean, this is straight-up health-care delivery.\u201d\n\nIn a city where growing prosperity conceals profound divides of race and class, the damage done by heroin and fentanyl has fallen squarely on African Americans. Of the 860 people known to have died of opioid overdoses since 2014, 4 in 5 were black, according to the chief medical examiner. In 2017 \u2014 the most recent year of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 the rate of fatal drug overdoses among African Americans in the District was higher than that of whites in West Virginia, Ohio or New Hampshire.\n\nAn unseen opioid epidemic in the nation\u2019s capital America\u2019s drug epidemic is commonly associated with rural towns and suburbs. But more people died from opioid overdoses than homicides last year in the District of Columbia as local government officials looked the other way. Read about how one couple of veteran users struggles to survive.\n\nYet those deaths, concentrated in the historically black neighborhoods of Southeast and Northeast Washington, have been unnoticed by many residents of the nation\u2019s capital. Few elected officials have taken prompt action to address the crisis. Frustrated advocates and medical professionals say the District\u2019s lackluster response would never have been tolerated in whiter and more affluent neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cPeople discount the severity of our opioid epidemic because it\u2019s mainly older, African American men who have used heroin long-term who are dying,\u201d said Kaitlyn Boecker, who works in the D.C. office of the Drug Policy Alliance, a national organization that works to change drug laws. \u201cThere just seems to be no urgency in addressing the crisis.\u201d\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser said in a statement that the District\u2019s strategies \u201care working and saving lives.\u201d (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nD.C. officials defended their response to surging opioid deaths, saying the past several years have been a learning period. Looking ahead, they said they are planning a comprehensive response to the epidemic, with the help of $21 million in new funding for opioid programs that the District is scheduled to receive from the federal government.\n\nMayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) declined repeated requests for an interview for this article. In a written statement, Bowser said the District\u2019s strategies \u201care working and saving lives.\u201d She noted that more than 700 overdose reversals have been reported using naloxone distributed by the city.\n\n\u201cWe will remain relentless in seeking the best possible tools and data to stop preventable overdose and death,\u201d Bowser said in the statement.\n\nThere are bright spots in the city\u2019s opioid response. Beginning late last year, the District gave out $1.7 million in local grants to increase the number of doctors and nurses trained to treat addiction. But there has been no corresponding spike in the number of patients signing up for treatment, according to city and federal data.\n\nAfter three straight years of increases, opioid deaths are on track to drop this year \u2014 although the number of projected fatalities will still be twice as many as in 2014, according to the District\u2019s chief medical examiner. Some city officials say the decline results from their prevention efforts.\n\nBut some medical experts think the trend \u2014 which mirrors a decline in fatal opioid overdoses seen in other cities and states \u2014 could have other causes. One theory holds that chronic users are beginning to adapt to fentanyl-tainted heroin, using it more carefully and in smaller doses.\n\nAnother is that four years into the District\u2019s opioid crisis, many of the addicts most at risk are already dead.\n\n(Andr\u00e9 Chung for The Washington Post) \u2018The only tools we have\u2019 Outreach worker Kenneth Poge hugs a client at the Family and Medical Counseling Service (FMCS) service needle-exchange service van. FMCS was one of two nonprofit groups tapped to distribute the life-saving overdose antidote naloxone in the District, but a manager says the program turned \u201cdisastrous\u201d when the city failed to provide enough of the medicine.\n\nMaurice Abbey-Bey stepped out of a minivan at the D.C. General shelter for homeless families, opened the trunk and announced his wares \u2014 free syringes, condoms and Narcan, a brand of naloxone nasal inhaler \u2014 in a hoarse shout. Among the dozens who lined up was Renee Jones-Collins, a resident of Southeast Washington.\n\nJones-Collins said she no longer uses heroin but has friends who do. The previous month, she said, she had used Narcan to revive one who had \u201cfallen out,\u201d or overdosed. She said that while fentanyl-laced heroin was \u201call over the place\u201d in the District, naloxone was comparably scarce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d she said.\n\nAbbey-Bey was selective with his 30 Narcan kits but quickly ran out. Soon he was driving back to the nonprofit Helping Individual Prostitutes Survive (HIPS), where naloxone provided by the city was carefully rationed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hold on to this stuff like it\u2019s dear life,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nThe D.C. Department of Health began its campaign to saturate overdose-heavy neighborhoods with Narcan in the spring of 2016. The department partnered with HIPS and Family and Medical Counseling Service (FMCS), another nonprofit that provides needle-exchange services, giving the organizations city-purchased Narcan to distribute.\n\nTerrence Cooper, a needle exchange coordinator with Family and Medical Counseling Service, watches for clients at Minnesota Avenue and Clay Place in Northeast. FMCS was one of two nonprofit organizations that participated in the District\u2019s troubled naloxone distribution program. (Andr\u00e9 Chung/for The Washington Post)\n\nThe city\u2019s management of the program has been \u201cdisastrous,\u201d said Diane Jones, a social worker who oversaw the initiative at FMCS. In an interview in May, she estimated that the approximately 150 kits FMCS was receiving from the city each month were half of what was needed. She said her organization routinely faced agonizing decisions about which clients are most deserving of the medicine.\n\n\u201cThese, at this point, are the only tools we have in this crisis,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re having to ration them out.\u201d\n\nSimilar complaints date to the earliest days of the city\u2019s naloxone initiative. On July 12, 2016 \u2014 approximately two months after the program got underway \u2014 then-HIPS employee Andrew Bell warned top health department officials that the group\u2019s Narcan supply was exhausted and it was unable to meet demand for the medicine.\n\n\u201cNot a day goes by that we don\u2019t have clients asking for naloxone,\u201d Bell said in an email.\n\nThe health department ultimately increased HIPS\u2019s Narcan supply. But the nonprofit organization continued to face shortages. In May of this year, HIPS launched an online donation drive when it was on the verge of running out of Narcan and the city refused to allow it to restock nine days early.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired of the city\u2019s woefully inadequate response to fatal overdoses in D.C.,\u201d the group wrote in its appeal. \u201cPlease donate today and help HIPS purchase our OWN supplies so we can do the city\u2019s job for them.\u201d\n\nHIPS Executive Director Cyndee Clay said other local governments were more aggressive in making sure naloxone reached drug users.\n\n\u201cThere are places where this is done well,\u201d she said. \u201cD.C. is just not one of them.\u201d\n\nOther municipalities have launched far more robust Narcan distribution campaigns, according to a Post analysis of data provided by those cities.\n\nIn 2017, Baltimore distributed an average 178 kits per month per 100,000 residents, and Philadelphia 141. Boston distributed 87 kits per month per 100,000 people, San Francisco 86 and New York City 59.\n\nThe District\u2019s figure: 38.\n\nD.C. Department of Health Director LaQuandra Nesbitt said complaints about naloxone shortages had been valuable feedback in what she described as a two-year test run. \u201cI want to emphasize it was a pilot, and so we wanted to hear from them what was working and what wasn\u2019t working,\u201d Nesbitt said.\n\nShe said the health department was overhauling the program so that HIPS and FMCS would receive funding to buy their own naloxone instead of relying on the city, a move she said should resolve disputes.\n\nNesbitt said it was wrong to judge the effectiveness of the District\u2019s program based on the number of Narcan kits that had been handed out without tracking other measures, such as whether overdose victims were offered medical care or long-term addiction treatment after their lives were saved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about whether or not naloxone was given \u2014 did you spray something in the nostrils. It\u2019s what happened as a result of that, and those things are critically important for us to understand,\u201d Nesbitt said.\n\nShe added, \u201cI don\u2019t determine the success of a program based merely on the number of kits that have been distributed.\u201d\n\nThat view goes against best practices for naloxone distribution, according to Eliza Wheeler, national overdose response strategist for the Harm Reduction Coalition.\n\n\u201cMeasuring the success of a naloxone program has to be based on how much naloxone gets into the hands of people who use drugs,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThe analogy that we use is thinking about a flu shot drive in the community.\u201d Such efforts are judged based on how many people at risk of flu get vaccinated, she said, not what happens to them afterward.\n\nThe District has also been an outlier when it comes to another means of increasing naloxone\u2019s availability: a government policy that allows anyone to buy the medication in a pharmacy without a doctor\u2019s prescription. As of January 2018, such policies existed in more than two dozen states, including neighboring Maryland and Virginia, according to the National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations.\n\nThe D.C. Council passed a law that would have allowed District residents access to the medication in pharmacies in 2016. But Nesbitt refused to implement it, saying the legislation gave too much authority to pharmacists and did not protect pharmacists who chose not to dispense naloxone from legal liability. She did not take action to make naloxone available until this month, when the council approved changes she requested to the policy.\n\n(Andr\u00e9 Chung for The Washington Post) \u2018It just fell apart\u2019 Dr. Edwin Chapman has treated hundreds of heroin users at his office in Northeast Washington. Chapman\u2019s practice was supposed to take part in a program for recent overdose victims at the District\u2019s public hospital \u2014 one of multiple federally funded initiatives the city failed to carry out.\n\nVictor Williams, a 56-year-old heroin user, was discharged the morning of Sept. 28 from United Medical Center (UMC), the District\u2019s public hospital, where he had been treated for an overdose. Close to midnight on the same day, his younger brother, Phillip Williams, got a call he had long dreaded.\n\nVictor had gone into the bathroom at Phillip Williams\u2019s house, according to a friend, and wasn\u2019t responding to knocks. The friend called 911. Phillip arrived home in time to see his brother \u2014 with whom he still stayed up late playing dominoes and pinochle, despite the damage heroin had done to their relationship \u2014 carried out the door in a body bag.\n\nA syringe was found in the bathroom. The medical examiner\u2019s office later determined that fentanyl killed Victor Williams.\n\nPhillip Williams, himself a recovering heroin user, said he thinks his brother could have been persuaded to enter treatment with professional outreach. \u201cWhen people that need help, that you should offer help, they can\u2019t get no help \u2014 they go back to what they used to know,\u201d he said, explaining his brother\u2019s relapses.\n\nVictor Williams, shown with his great-granddaughter.

(Courtesy of Williams family)\n\nWhat Phillip Williams didn\u2019t know until recently was that an outreach program for overdose victims like Victor should have been in place at UMC more than a year ago \u2014 one of several federally funded initiatives that D.C. officials failed to carry out.\n\nAlong with every state and four U.S. territories, the District was awarded money to combat the opioid epidemic under the 21st Century Cures Act, signed by then-President Barack Obama in December 2016. The city\u2019s eligibility for the grant \u2014 $2 million a year, for two years \u2014 gave it an advantage over municipalities with no direct access to federal money for anti-opioid campaigns.\n\nThat advantage has led to few results. Outreach initiatives to heroin users the grant was supposed to fund never materialized. At the height of the epidemic last year, District officials failed to spend $620,000 of their federal money, or about a third of the amount allotted to the city in the grant\u2019s first year.\n\nThe grant was overseen by the D.C. Department of Behavioral Health, which along with the Department of Health manages the District\u2019s opioid strategies. In its application, the agency described an extensive street outreach effort, with a group of 10 peer counselors \u2014 former drug users trained to counsel others about treatment options \u2014 visiting spots where heroin users gather.\n\nHowever, in an August 2017 strategic plan the department submitted to the federal government, agency officials said they were having trouble recruiting outreach workers. An initial training session in May hadn\u2019t drawn enough participants to launch the peer outreach program as originally planned, they wrote.\n\nInstead, the agency said it would launch a more focused outreach campaign at a location where peer counselors could be sure to encounter drug users: a hospital emergency room. Two counselors would be stationed at UMC, city officials said, shepherding recent overdose victims to on-site treatment with buprenorphine, a medication that diminishes opioid cravings.\n\nSimilar programs have been launched in multiple cities, based on a 2015 study at Yale-New Haven Hospital that showed users who begin buprenorphine treatment during visits to the emergency room often have more success in recovery.\n\n\u201cWe really have an opportunity to see a lot of these patients in that wake-up moment,\u201d said Ali Raja, a physician who oversaw the introduction of a buprenorphine program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston last year.\n\nUMC was an ideal site. Last year, it saw 400 opioid overdose patients, far more than any other hospital in the nation\u2019s capital, according to city data. Medical Home Development Group, the city\u2019s contracted buprenorphine treatment provider, leased an office two floors above the hospital\u2019s emergency room in anticipation of the program.\n\nBut the city\u2019s promised outreach workers never showed up. The office, rather than treating overdose victims from the emergency room, is now used for other patients, said Edwin Chapman, MHDG\u2019s chief medical officer.\n\nChapman, who treats Phillip Williams at his practice on Benning Road NE, said Victor Williams was just one of many patients whose lives could have been saved if the city had followed through.\n\nEdwin C. Chapman, chief medical officer for Medical Home Development Group, said D.C. officials could have saved lives if they had followed through on a plan for outreach to overdose victims at the city\u2019s public hospital. (Andr\u00e9 Chung/for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cIt just fell apart,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cThey reneged on everything.\u201d\n\nTanya Royster, who until two weeks ago was the director of the D.C. Department of Behavioral Health, said in an interview that she was unable to provide any information about why the city never carried out the program at UMC. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a later email, department spokeswoman Jasmine Gossett denied the program had ever been planned. After she was shown the plan submitted by the department to the federal government, Gossett acknowledged the proposed UMC project but said it was part of an interim plan and not \u201can official proposal.\u201d\n\nOther initiatives outlined as part of the city\u2019s grant documents likewise made little progress. An effort to persuade 125 older patients at the city\u2019s methadone clinics to switch to buprenorphine treatment \u2014 which, unlike methadone, is fully covered by Medicare \u2014 went nowhere.\n\nAs time passed with no action or direction from the city on the grant programs, MHDG used the federal money it had been paid to offer primary care to patients at the Foundation for Contemporary Mental Health, a methadone clinic in Foggy Bottom.\n\nThe attention was welcomed by men and women who often have grave health problems after decades of addiction, but it was not treatment for drug abuse. Although MHDG received $1.46 million of the city\u2019s $4 million in total grant funds, it ultimately did not treat a single patient for opioid addiction in connection with the grant.\n\nDepartment of Behavioral Health officials acknowledged problems with the grant in a July report to the federal government. They said the District had spent $1.38 million of the $2 million awarded in the grant\u2019s first year, citing \u201ca lack of clarity in communicating to the sub-grantees their roles and responsibilities\u201d and \u201cunexpected turnover\u201d in the department staff overseeing opioid programs.\n\nRoyster had a more positive appraisal. She told The Post it was normal to leave federal grant money unspent in the first year, and pointed to a use of the funds that she said had been successful: Some $200,000 spent on posters that warned drug users of fentanyl and promoted naloxone.\n\nShe acknowledged her agency was not using tried-and-true strategies other governments have adopted but said this was a strength rather than a weakness. The city\u2019s approach has been tailored to its distinctive population of older, African American heroin users, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not behind the curve. We\u2019re actually, I would say, ahead of the curve,\u201d Royster said. \u201cAnd one of the ways that you can be confident of that is that we\u2019re not just doing what everyone else is doing. We\u2019re doing what\u2019s important for D.C.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions from The Post about the District\u2019s use of its grant money, SAMHSA spokesman Brian Dominguez said grant recipients \u201chave flexibility to design their systems and plans.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 30, after her interview with The Post and before this article was published, Royster was removed from her job by the mayor. A Bowser administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter, said the mayor had grown frustrated with the slowness of the agency\u2019s responses to various issues, including drug overdoses.\n\nBowser chose as a replacement Nesbitt, who will continue leading the Department of Health while overseeing the Department of Behavioral Health on a temporary basis.\n\n(Andr\u00e9 Chung for The Washington Post) Just another day Heroin user Eugene Short, 47, strips copper wire outside the FMCS needle-exchange van. Four years after overdose deaths among African Americans began climbing, advocates say recent improvements to the city\u2019s opioid response have come far too late.\n\nThere is at least one precedent for a more successful opioid program managed by city officials. Last year, the Department of Health began giving out $1.7 million to help clinics hire and train medical staff for buprenorphine programs. Five clinics, along with Howard University Hospital, obtained funding.\n\nThe money has been one factor in a rapid expansion of addiction treatment providers in the District. The federal government has certified at least 150 new buprenorphine prescribers \u2014 with a capacity to treat 5,550 patients \u2014 over the past two years, SAMHSA data show.\n\nD.C. expanded opioid addiction treatment opportunities, but patient growth lags Additional treatment capacity and Medicaid patients in the past two years 132 more Medicaid patients 5,550 added treatment capacity Note: New capacity is based on the maximum number of patients new doctors can accept.

Department of Health Care Finance KATE RABINOWITZ/THE WASHINGTON POST\n\nBut the rate at which patients most at risk are entering treatment has not kept up. Since 2016, the number of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving buprenorphine has increased by 132 people, according to data from the D.C. Department of Health Care Finance.\n\nAfter training new buprenorphine prescribers with city funding, the addiction clinic at Mary\u2019s Center in Adams Morgan is now able to treat roughly 500 people, said Daniel Smith, the doctor who oversees the program. It currently has about 135 patients, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re growing, and we grow every month by 5 or 10 percent,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not close to our capacity.\u201d\n\nThe District will have ample opportunity to close its treatment gap over the next two years, as it begins receiving $21 million annually in new federal funding for local governments to combat the opioid crisis.\n\nThe Department of Behavioral Health, which will oversee the grant, outlined dozens of new programs in its grant application, some of which expand on unfulfilled initiatives from the past two years. The city is planning to launch outreach programs for overdose patients in multiple hospitals, with both the new federal money and unused funds left over from its earlier grant.\n\nFMCS needle exchange specialist Tyrone Pinkney, center, and his colleague Terrence Cooper interview Marlon Brando Robinson, 53, inside the organization\u2019s mobile-services van.

In August, the health department began distributing naloxone through homeless shelters.\n\nThis month, the D.C. Council approved a package of changes sought by treatment providers to the District\u2019s opioid policies, including the removal of restrictions on Medicaid reimbursement for addiction treatment. The bill was originally introduced in 2017, and took almost 15 months to come to a vote.\n\nSome on the front lines of the epidemic say these developments are welcome but come after inexcusable delays.\n\n\u201cThey could have saved a lot of lives,\u201d said Robert Keisling, a physician who runs one of the city\u2019s most active addiction medicine practices. \u201cIt\u2019s way late. But late is better than never.\u201d\n\nIn Marvin Gaye Park, a notorious hangout for heroin users in Northeast Washington, a small group gathered on Aug. 31 \u2014 International Overdose Awareness Day \u2014 to remember those for whom help did not come soon enough.\n\nLewis Blakeney, a 62-year-old recovering heroin user who has survived two overdoses, estimated that a dozen older black men who had once nodded off alongside him on the park benches were now dead.

But today's average height of 5 feet, 9 inches is about a tenth of an inch shorter than about a decade ago.\n\nThe average woman in the early 1960s was 5 feet, 3 inches and 140 pounds. Now, women are a half-inch taller and about 30 pounds heavier, on average. The average height is about the same as it was a decade earlier: 5 feet, 4 inches.\n\nOther survey findings:\n\n\u2014 In the last decade, the average weight of men rose about 2 pounds, to 198. For women, it rose 6 pounds, to nearly 171.\n\n\u2014 Men have 40-inch waistlines, on average. Women's waistlines are a little under 39 inches.\n\n\u2014 The average height of black men and white men has been holding about steady, at a little under 5 feet 10.\n\n\u2014 Mexican-American and Asian-American men are roughly 3 inches shorter than whites and blacks, on average. There was a similar height gap in women.\n\nIn 2016, about 18 percent of the nation's population was Hispanic, up from about 13 percent in 2000, according to U.S. Census figures. Mexican-Americans account for nearly two-thirds of the Hispanic population.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.
